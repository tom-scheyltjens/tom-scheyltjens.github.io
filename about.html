        Behind the facts
      </h1>
      <p>So, whats behind the facts... I was born and raised in the quit Kempen region near Turnhout. I went to secundary school in Turnhout
      and got my bachelor degree in social work in Geel.</p>
      <img src='images/run-tom.jpg' alt="Tom with Half marathon finishers medal"/>
      <p>After my studies I started working as a counselor for the union (ACV-CSC). Most of the time I helped people to file for unemployment benefits,
      but a lot of the job involved informing people about their rights concerninng their work and employer. After a couple of years I was looking for
      a new opportunity. The rate of unemployment was getting less so I started the follow lessons in the evening to become a developer. I also switched
      my career from counseling to teaching. For the last two years I trained new collegues on the job and tried to get all collegues up to date with new
      legislation. I was still following programming lessons and when I got my degree there, I knew this was what I wanted to do so I prepared myself form
      a new career and... here I am.
      <p/>
      <p>Personnaly, I married in 2017. Me and my wife have three kids, the oldest, Floris, is 5, the middle one, Jules is 3, and the youngest sprout, Felien is 2 months
      old. Always something to do when I'm at home.
      </p>
      <p>When I'm not entertaining my kids. I like to sport. I try to run 3 times a week, I play football and I try to bike at least once a week. I recently ran my First
      half marathon in Antwerp as pictured on the right.
      </p>
      <p> So that's all for now. Feel free to ask away if you have any questions.</p>
